              Stripe powers our checkout and payouts, bringing modern security
              and reliable infrastructure to Splitify payments. In plain
              English: it&#39;s safe, it&#39;s fast, and it just works.
            </p>

            <h2>Secure by default</h2>
            <p>
              Stripe tokenizes payment details so sensitive information never
              touches Splitify servers. Features like PCI-compliant handling, 3D
              Secure, and built-in fraud detection keep transactions safe.
            </p>

            <h2>Fast and flexible</h2>
            <p>
              Support for major cards and bank payments where available, with
              settlement that helps reimbursements land without long delays.
            </p>

            <h2>Great checkout experience</h2>
            <p>
              Polished, mobile-friendly checkout reduces friction and increases
              completed payments. Your friends can pay from their phones in
              seconds.
            </p>

            <h2>What it means for you</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear receipts for everyone involved.</li>
              <li>
                Refunds and adjustments handled cleanly through the same flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consistent performance backed by industry-standard
                infrastructure.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Payments should be the easy part. With Splitify and Stripe, they
              are.
