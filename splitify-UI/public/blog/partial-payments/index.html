              Life is messy&mdash;payments can be too. Splitify lets you accept
              partial payments, add adjustments, and keep everyone in the loop
              with a clear history.
            </p>

            <h2>Accept partial payments</h2>
            <p>
              Record partial amounts as they arrive. We update remaining
              balances automatically and issue receipts so everyone knows
              what&#39;s left.
            </p>

            <h2>Common scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Deposits:</strong> Someone can only cover part of rent
                now, the rest on payday.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shared purchases:</strong> One person returns an item,
                so their share drops.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rolling balances:</strong> You want to carry over a
                small remainder to next month.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Apply credits or adjustments</h2>
            <p>
              Add discounts, fees, or reimbursements with a short reason (e.g.,
              &quot;credit for outage&quot;). It keeps the history transparent
              and prevents confusion later.
            </p>

            <h2>Stay transparent</h2>
            <p>
              Every change is tracked with timestamps and notes. Participants
              can always see what they owe, what they paid, and why it changed.
            </p>

            <h2>Tips for smooth sailing</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use short notes to explain partials (&quot;paid $50, remainder
                $32.20&quot;).
              </li>
              <li>
                Align on a simple policy for fees, discounts, or pro-rating.
              </li>
              <li>
                For recurring bills, resolve small remainders monthly so
                balances don&#39;t drift.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Partial payments don&#39;t have to be complicated. Splitify makes
              the math clear and the follow‑through automatic.
