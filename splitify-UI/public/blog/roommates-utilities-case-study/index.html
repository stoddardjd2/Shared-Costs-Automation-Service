              Meet Alex, Priya, Jonah, and Mei. Their $154.00 internet bill just
              landed. Here&#39;s how they split and paid it in under a minute
              without a single &quot;hey did you see my message?&quot; in the
              group chat.
            </p>

            <h2>Set up (20 seconds)</h2>
            <p>
              Alex opens Splitify, creates a new cost called &quot;Internet
              &mdash; March,&quot; selects equal split for four people, and sets
              the due date to Friday. He adds a short note: &quot;Thanks
              all!&quot;
            </p>

            <h2>Send (10 seconds)</h2>
            <p>
              Alex taps send. Splitify delivers clear requests with each
              person&#39;s exact amount ($38.50), the due date, and a secure
              payment link.
            </p>

            <h2>Gentle reminders (automatic)</h2>
            <p>
              Two people pay right away. The others get a polite reminder the
              day before it&#39;s due. No nagging, no awkwardness.
            </p>

            <h2>Done (the next day)</h2>
            <p>
              Within 24 hours, all four payments are in. The dashboard shows
              &quot;Paid&quot; across the board, and receipts are saved
              automatically.
            </p>

            <h2>What made it smooth</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Everyone saw their exact amount and due date up front.</li>
              <li>Paying took seconds on mobile.</li>
              <li>
                Reminders were spaced and polite (and stopped as soon as someone
                paid).
              </li>
            </ul>
