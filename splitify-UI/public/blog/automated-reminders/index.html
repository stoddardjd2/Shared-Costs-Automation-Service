              Chasing people for money is awkward. The right reminder, at the
              right time, in the right tone, makes it a whole lot easier.
              Splitify handles the timing and the message so you can keep things
              friendly and still get paid.
            </p>

            <h2>Why reminders feel awkward (and how we help)</h2>
            <p>
              Most of us don't want to nag. We also don't want to be left
              holding the bill. Splitify strikes the balance by keeping messages
              short, specific, and respectful&mdash;so your relationships stay
              front and center.
            </p>

            <h2>Smart, spaced timing</h2>
            <p>
              We send gentle nudges close to the due date, with sensible spacing
              so no one feels spammed. If someone pays, reminders stop
              immediately. Need to pause for a week? You can snooze a request
              with one click.
            </p>

            <h2>Clear, actionable messages</h2>
            <p>
              Every reminder includes the exact amount due, the due date, and a
              secure payment link. No guesswork, no searching through old
              messages. People can pay from their phone in seconds.
            </p>

            <h2>Your voice, not a robot</h2>
            <p>
              Add a short note when you send the request (&quot;Hey! Internet
              bill for March&mdash;thanks!&quot;). That tone carries through to
              reminders so it feels like you, just automated.
            </p>

            <h2>Channels that respect attention</h2>
            <p>
              We primarily use email for reminders and reserve SMS for urgent,
              time-sensitive nudges when appropriate. Participants can opt out
              or change their preferences at any time.
            </p>

            <h3>Example reminder copy</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Subject:</strong> Quick nudge about your split</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Body:</strong> "Hi Sam&mdash;just a reminder that $38.50
                for Wi‑Fi is due on Friday. Pay securely here: [link]. Thanks
                again!"
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Full control when you need it</h2>
            <p>
              Pause reminders for a single person, skip the next reminder, or
              change the due date if plans change. You stay in control while
              Splitify handles the follow‑through.
            </p>

            <h2>Best practices we've learned</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Set clear due dates up front (e.g., "by Friday").</li>
              <li>Add a friendly note on the first send to set the tone.</li>
              <li>Keep amounts precise and visible in the message.</li>
              <li>
                Use reminders sparingly; trust the system to do the nudging.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Reminders shouldn't strain relationships. They should remove
              friction. With Splitify, they do.
