              Splitting bills should be effortless. In 2025, the best apps do
              three things really well: connect securely to your bank, support
              flexible split methods, and help you collect on time without
              awkward follow-ups. Here&#39;s a practical roundup to help you
              choose.
            </p>

            <h2>What to look for</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Secure connections:</strong> Uses trusted partners (like
                Plaid) so logins never touch the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flexible splits:</strong> Equal shares, fixed amounts,
                or percentages&mdash;mix and match when needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Polite automation:</strong> Reminders that are spaced,
                humane, and easy to pause.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reliable payments:</strong> Powered by modern rails
                (like Stripe) with clear receipts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone can see what they owe
                and how it was calculated.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Popular options</h2>
            <h3>Splitwise</h3>
            <p>
              The classic tracker for shared expenses. Great for logging, OK for
              settling up. Payments depend on region and might require extra
              steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Best for:</em> Long-running house shares that prioritize
              tracking over instant pay.
            </p>

            <h3>Venmo / Cash App</h3>
            <p>
              Fantastic for quick person-to-person pay, but splitting logic,
              tracking, and reminders are limited. Works best if you already
              know who owes what.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Best for:</em> One-off reimbursements with friends who already
              use the app.
            </p>

            <h3>Settle Up</h3>
            <p>
              A focused expense splitter with groups and history. Payment flows
              vary by country; solid for travel groups and shared events.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Best for:</em> Trips and temporary groups that need a running
              balance.
            </p>

            <h3>Splitify</h3>
            <p>
              Built for speed, clarity, and fewer awkward conversations. Create
              a cost, pick a split, set a due date, and send. Reminders are
              respectful and payments are handled securely.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Best for:</em> Roommates, recurring bills, and any situation
              where you want a clear request and a simple path to pay.
            </p>

            <h2>How Splitify compares</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Bank sync:</strong> Secure connections and optional
                imports where supported.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flexible math:</strong> Equal, fixed, or percentage
                splits&mdash;including mixed methods.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Automated reminders:</strong> Friendly by default, easy
                to pause or skip.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fast checkout:</strong> Modern payment rails with clear
                receipts for everyone.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Does it clearly show who owes what?</li>
              <li>Can you split in different ways without a spreadsheet?</li>
              <li>Are reminders respectful and low-friction?</li>
