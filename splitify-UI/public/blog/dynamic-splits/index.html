              Not every split is equal. Sometimes one person uses more, another
              has a discount, or someone only participates part of the month.
              Splitify supports equal shares, fixed amounts, percentages, and
              combinations&mdash;so your group can be fair without a
              spreadsheet.
            </p>

            <h2>Equal, fixed, or percentage</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Equal</strong> works well for shared utilities or
              subscriptions. <strong>Fixed</strong> is great when someone covers
              a base fee. <strong>Percentage</strong> fits variable usage or
              income-based fairness.
            </p>

            <h2>Real-world examples</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Roommates + couple:</strong> Four roommates, two of whom
                share a room. Give the couple a larger combined share with
                percentages while keeping others equal.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Gym membership:</strong> One person uses premium
                classes. Assign them a fixed add-on, then split the rest
                equally.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Partial month:</strong> A friend stays half the month.
                Set their share to 50% for that cycle.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Edge cases considered</h2>
            <p>
              Rounding, partial participants, and minimums are handled
              consistently so totals always add up. Mixed methods are calculated
              in a predictable order and shown to everyone.
            </p>

            <h2>Clarity for everyone</h2>
            <p>
              Participants see their amount and how it was calculated. This
              reduces back-and-forth and builds trust&mdash;especially helpful
              for recurring bills.
            </p>

            <h2>Tips for fairness</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Agree on a simple rule before money is involved.</li>
              <li>When in doubt, show the math in the request note.</li>
              <li>
                Revisit splits if living situations change (new roommate,
                move-out, etc.).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              However you split, Splitify makes the math clear and the
              follow‑through automatic. <a href="/signup">Give it a try</a> with
